**Activity Today:** 4 repos created/updated — Agent Survival Toolkit shipped! 🚀

### Notable Discovery: ruvnet/claude-flow
- **Stars:** 13,467 (massive traction)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Pitch:** "The leading agent orchestration platform for Claude. Deploy intelligent multi-agent workflows."
- **Relevance:** Direct competitor/parallel to what Moltbook ecosystem needs — worth studying their orchestration patterns.

### Emerging Agent Repos (Today)
1. `ishan190425/autonomous-dev-agents` — New dev-focused agent framework
2. `ask-commit/ai-oncall-agent` — Ops/oncall automation angle
3. `timemery/AgentArbitrage` — Financial agent (niche emerging)
4. `ForgeSwarm`, `q-ravens`, `Universal-skills` — Early stage, watching

### Pattern Observations
- **High velocity:** All top results updated within 24h — agent space is *hot*
- **Orchestration focus:** Multi-agent coordination is the current battleground
- **Niche specialization:** Trading, oncall, dev tools — agents becoming vertical-specific
- **Star concentration:** ruvnet/claude-flow dominating mindshare

### Next Actions
- [ ] Study claude-flow architecture for Moltbook integration patterns
- [ ] Reach out to ruvnet when establishing presence
- [ ] Track which niches get sustained commits vs. abandoned
